# js深入原理系列之闭包

## 疑问与目的

1. 闭包是为了解决什么问题？
2. js引擎中闭包的原理是怎样的？

## 闭包概念
承接[《js代码执行算法》](js%e4%bb%a3%e7%a0%81%e6%89%a7%e8%a1%8c%e7%ae%97%e6%b3%95.md)文章，提及了闭包与scope相关。

### 函数式语言概念
js实现了函数式编程，那么函数式函数有什么概念？可查看[《Functional programming》](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)介绍。
在[《Closures》](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/chapter-6-closures/)中，有以下原话：
```
A functional argument (“Funarg”) — is an argument which value is a function.

In turn, a function which receives another function as the argument is called a higher-order function (HOF).

A function which returns another function is called a function with a functional value (or a function-valued function).

Functions which can participate as normal data, i.e. be passed as arguments, receive functional arguments or be returned as functional values, are called first-class functions.In ECMAScript all functions are first-class.

Funarg problem

On return from a function the variables are popped from the stack. This model is a big restriction for using functions as functional values (i.e. returning them from parent functions). Mostly this problem appears when a function uses free variables.

A free variable is a variable which is used by a function, but is neither a parameter, nor a local variable of the function.

Another problem of functional objects is related with passing a function as an argument in a system with dynamic scope implementation.
let z = 10;
 
function foo() {
  console.log(z);
}
 
foo(); // 10 – with using both static and dynamic scope
 
(function () {
 
  let z = 20;
  // NOTE: always 10 in JS!
  foo(); // 10 – with static scope, 20 – with dynamic scope
 
})();
 
// the same with passing foo
// as an arguments
 
(function (funArg) {
 
  let z = 30;
  funArg(); // 10 – with static scope, 30 – with dynamic scope
 
})(foo);

We see that in systems with dynamic scope, variable resolution is managed with a dynamic (active) stack of variables. Thus, free variables are searched in the dynamic chain of the current activation — in the place where the function is called, but not in the static (lexical) scope chain which is saved at function creation.

And this can lead to ambiguity. Thus, even if z exists (in contrast with the previous example where local variables would be removed from a stack), there is a question: which value of z (i.e. z from which context, from which scope) should be used in various calls of foo function?

The described cases are two types of the funarg problem — depending on whether we deal with the functional value returned from a function (upward funarg), or with the functional argument passed to the function (downward funarg).

For solving this problem (and its subtypes) the concept of a closure was proposed.

A closure is a combination of a code block and data of a context in which this code block is created.
```
如上述提及了，funarg指的是参数为函数，HOF指的是入参为funarg的函数，a function-valued function指的是返回值为函数的函数，free variable指的是既不是入参也不是本地参数的变量；funarg问题，一是funarg变量返回问题，二是动态传递funarg问题；闭包就是为了这两问题而产生的。

### js中闭包的实现原理
在[《Closures》](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/chapter-6-closures/)中，有以下原话：
```
Technically, the parent environment is saved in the internal [[Scope]] property of a function. So if we completely understand the [[Scope]] and the scope chain topics, which in detail were discussed in the chapter 4, the question on understanding closures in ECMAScript will disappear by itself.

Referencing to algorithm of functions creation, we see that all functions in ECMAScript are closures, since all of them at creation save scope chain of a parent context. The important moment here is that, regardless — whether a function will be activated later or not — the parent scope is already captured in it at creation time:

let x = 10; 
function foo() {
  console.log(x);
}
 
// foo is a closure
foo: <FunctionObject> = {
  [[Call]]: <code block of foo>,
  [[Scope]]: [
    global: {
      x: 10
    }
  ],
  ... // other properties
};

As we mentioned, for optimization purposes, when a function does not use free variables, implementations may not to save a parent scope chain. However, in ECMAScript specification nothing is said about it; therefore, formally (and by the technical algorithm) — all functions save scope chain in the [[Scope]] property at creation moment.

Some implementations allow access to the closured scope directly. For example in Rhino, for the [[Scope]] property of a function, corresponds a non-standard property __parent__ which we discussed in the chapter about variable object:

It is necessary to notice that closured [[Scope]] in ECMAScript is the same object for several inner functions created in this parent context. It means that modifying the closured variable from one closure, affects the variable in another closure.

That is, all inner functions share the same parent environment.

let firstClosure;
let secondClosure;
 
function foo() {
 
  let x = 1;
 
  firstClosure = function () { return ++x; };
  secondClosure = function () { return --x; };
 
  x = 2; // affection on AO["x"], which is in [[Scope]] of both closures
 
  console.log(firstClosure()); // 3, via firstClosure.[[Scope]]
}
 
foo();
 
console.log(firstClosure()); // 4
console.log(secondClosure()); // 3

There is a widespread mistake related with this feature. Often programmers get unexpected result, when create functions in a loop, trying to associate with every function the loop’s counter variable, expecting that every function will keep its “own” needed value.

ES6 standardized block scope, which is achieved using let, or const keywords in variable declarations. 

let data = [];
for (let k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
  data[k] = function () {
    console.log(k);
  };
}
 
// Also correct output.
data[0](); // 0
data[1](); // 1
data[2](); // 2

Another feature is returning from closures. In ECMAScript, a return statement from a closure returns the control flow to a calling context (a caller).

As we noted, often developers incompletely understand as closures only inner functions returned from parent context.

Let’s make a note again, that all functions, independently from their type: anonymous, named, function expression or function declaration, because of the scope chain mechanism, are closures.

An exception to this rule can be functions created via Function constructor which [[Scope]] contains only global object.

And to clarify this question, let’s provide two correct versions of closures regarding ECMAScript:

Closures in ECMAScript are:

	from the theoretical viewpoint: all functions, since all they save at creation variables of a parent context. Even a simple global function, referencing a global variable refers a free variable and therefore, the general scope chain mechanism is used;

	from the practical viewpoint: those functions are interesting which:
		continue to exist after their parent context is finished, e.g. inner functions returned from a parent function;
		use free variables.
```
如上述所示，the parent environment信息保存在scope中，基于优化的目的，有些js引擎没有使用free variable直接提供访问；而有些js引擎则提供了__parent__变量访问；所有的内部函数共享parent environment的数据，最典型的例子是，在for循环中定义内部函数传递变量；解决该问题使用es6中定义的block级别的let语法。由于scope chain的原理，在js中所有的函数都是闭包，除了那些scope chain中只有global object数据的。
