## object概念
在[es6.0](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-execution-contexts)中，有以下原话：
```
Even though ECMAScript includes syntax for class definitions, ECMAScript objects are not fundamentally class-based such as those in C++, Smalltalk, or Java. Instead objects may be created in various ways including via a literal notation or via constructors which create objects and then execute code that initializes all or part of them by assigning initial values to their properties. Each constructor is a function that has a property named "prototype" that is used to implement prototype-based inheritance and shared properties. Objects are created by using constructors in new expressions; for example, new Date(2009,11) creates a new Date object. Invoking a constructor without using new has consequences that depend on the constructor. For example, Date() produces a string representation of the current date and time rather than an object.

Every object created by a constructor has an implicit reference (called the object’s prototype) to the value of its constructor’s "prototype" property. Furthermore, a prototype may have a non-null implicit reference to its prototype, and so on; this is called the prototype chain. When a reference is made to a property in an object, that reference is to the property of that name in the first object in the prototype chain that contains a property of that name. In other words, first the object mentioned directly is examined for such a property; if that object contains the named property, that is the property to which the reference refers; if that object does not contain the named property, the prototype for that object is examined next; and so on.

In a class-based object-oriented language, in general, state is carried by instances, methods are carried by classes, and inheritance is only of structure and behaviour. In ECMAScript, the state and methods are carried by objects, while structure, behaviour, and state are all inherited.
```
上述表明，js不是面向对象语言，对象可以由多种方式创建，通过字面量、构造器等；构造器则有prototype属性，用来继承和分享属性，对象则可以用new constructors表达式创建。被创建的对象则有隐藏的引用属性，指向构造器的prototype。最后一段话，指出面向对象语言，类实例存储状态，类存储方法，继承则继承了结构、行为；而在js中，状态、方法存储在对象中，结构、行为、状态均能继承。

在[JavaScript. The Core](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/javascript-the-core-2nd-edition/)中，有以下原话：
```
Object: An object is a collection of properties, and has a single prototype object. The prototype may be either an object or the null value.

Prototype: A prototype is a delegation object used to implement prototype-based inheritance.

Prototype chain: A prototype chain is a finite chain of objects used to implement inheritance and shared properties

Delegation: a mechanism used to resolve a property in the inheritance chain. The process happens at runtime, hence is also called dynamic dispatch

Constructor(new): A constructor is a function which is used to create instances, and automatically set their prototype.

## object原理
object内置属性
```
Each object should implement the following internal properties and methods:

+ [[Prototype]] — the prototype of this object (it will be considered below in detail);
+ [[Class]] — a string representation of object’s kind (for example, Object, Array, Function, etc.); it is used to distinguish the objects;
+ [[Get]] — a method of getting the property’s value;
+ [[Put]] — a method of setting the property’s value;
+ [[CanPut]] — checks whether writing to the property is possible;
+ [[HasProperty]] — checks whether the object has already this property;
+ [[Delete]] — removes the property from the object;
+ [[DefaultValue]] — returns a primitive value corresponding with the object (for getting this value the valueOf method is called; for some objects, TypeError exception can be thrown).
```

创建function伪码 
```
F = new NativeObject();
  
// property [[Class]] is "Function"
F.[[Class]] = "Function"
  
// a prototype of a function object
F.[[Prototype]] = Function.prototype
  
// reference to function itself
// [[Call]] is activated by call expression F()
// and creates a new execution context
F.[[Call]] = <reference to function>
  
// built in general constructor of objects
// [[Construct]] is activated via "new" keyword
// and it is the one who allocates memory for new
// objects; then it calls F.[[Call]]
// to initialize created objects passing as
// "this" value newly created object 
F.[[Construct]] = internalConstructor
  
// scope chain of the current context
// i.e. context which creates function F
F.[[Scope]] = activeContext.Scope
// if this functions is created 
// via new Function(...), then
F.[[Scope]] = globalContext.Scope
  
// number of formal parameters
F.length = countParameters
  
// a prototype of created by F objects
__objectPrototype = new Object();
__objectPrototype.constructor = F // {DontEnum}, is not enumerable in loops
F.prototype = __objectPrototype

return F
```

对象分配算法
```
F.[[Construct]](initialParameters):
 
O = new NativeObject();
 
// property [[Class]] is set to "Object", i.e. simple object
O.[[Class]] = "Object"
 
// get the object on which
// at the moment references F.prototype
var __objectPrototype = F.prototype;
 
// if __objectPrototype is an object, then:
O.[[Prototype]] = __objectPrototype
// else:
O.[[Prototype]] = Object.prototype;
// where O.[[Prototype]] is the prototype of the object
 
// initialization of the newly created object
// applying the F.[[Call]]; pass:
// as this value – newly created object - O,
// arguments are the same as initialParameters for F
R = F.[[Call]](initialParameters); this === O;
// where R is the returned value of the [[Call]]
// in JS view it looks like:
// R = F.apply(O, initialParameters);
 
// if R is an object
return R
// else
return O
```
