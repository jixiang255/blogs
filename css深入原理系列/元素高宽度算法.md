# css深入理解系列之元素宽高度算法

## 疑问与目的
1. 元素的高宽度如何计算？

## 术语
在[replaced element](http://devdocs.io/css/replaced_element)有如下定义：
```
In CSS, a replaced element is an element whose representation is outside the scope of CSS. In other words, these are external objects whose representation is independent of the CSS formatting model.

在[Intrinsic Size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#intrinsic)有如下定义：
```
Intrinsic sizing determines sizes based on the contents of an element, without regard for its context.
```

Typical replaced elements are:
    · <iframe>
    · <video>
    · <embed>
    · <img>
```
大体意思是replaced element指的是不遵守元素盒子模型的元素。

在官方定义[css2.1 float-width](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#float-width)和[stackoverflow shrink-to-fit](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32927609/css-container-div-shrink-to-fit-contents)文章中，描述如下
```
Calculate the preferred width by formatting the content without breaking lines other than where explicit line breaks occur
Also calculate the preferred minimum width, e.g., by trying all possible line breaks. CSS 2.1 does not define the exact algorithm.
Find the available width: in this case, this is the width of the containing block minus the used values of margin-left,  border-left-width, padding-left, padding-right,  border-right-width, margin-right, and the widths of any relevant scroll bars.
Then the shrink-to-fit width is:

min(max(preferred minimum width, available width), preferred width)
```

## 计算元素宽度
在[css2.1 宽度](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/visudet.html#Computing_widths_and_margins)中，有如下原话：
```
The values of an element's 'width', 'margin-left', 'margin-right', 'left' and 'right' properties as used for layout depend on the type of box generated and on each other. (The value used for layout is sometimes referred to as the used value.) In principle, the values used are the same as the computed values, with 'auto' replaced by some suitable value, and percentages calculated based on the containing block, but there are exceptions. The following situations need to be distinguished:

	· inline, non-replaced elements
	· inline, replaced elements
	· block-level, non-replaced elements in normal flow
	· block-level, replaced elements in normal flow
	· floating, non-replaced elements
	· floating, replaced elements
	· absolutely positioned, non-replaced elements
	· absolutely positioned, replaced elements
	· 'inline-block', non-replaced elements in normal flow
	· 'inline-block', replaced elements in normal flow

10.3.1 Inline, non-replaced elements

The 'width' property does not apply. A computed value of 'auto' for 'margin-left' or 'margin-right' becomes a used value of '0'.

10.3.2 Inline, replaced elements

A computed value of 'auto' for 'margin-left' or 'margin-right' becomes a used value of '0'.

If 'height' and 'width' both have computed values of 'auto' and the element also has an intrinsic width, then that intrinsic width is the used value of 'width'.

If 'height' and 'width' both have computed values of 'auto' and the element has no intrinsic width, but does have an intrinsic height and intrinsic ratio; or if 'width' has a computed value of 'auto', 'height' has some other computed value, and the element does have an intrinsic ratio; then the used value of 'width' is:

(used height) * (intrinsic ratio)

If 'height' and 'width' both have computed values of 'auto' and the element has an intrinsic ratio but no intrinsic height or width, then the used value of 'width' is undefined in CSS 2.1. However, it is suggested that, if the containing block's width does not itself depend on the replaced element's width, then the used value of 'width' is calculated from the constraint equation used for block-level, non-replaced elements in normal flow.

Otherwise, if 'width' has a computed value of 'auto', and the element has an intrinsic width, then that intrinsic width is the used value of 'width'.

Otherwise, if 'width' has a computed value of 'auto', but none of the conditions above are met, then the used value of 'width' becomes 300px. If 300px is too wide to fit the device, UAs should use the width of the largest rectangle that has a 2:1 ratio and fits the device instead.

10.3.3 Block-level, non-replaced elements in normal flow

The following constraints must hold among the used values of the other properties:

'margin-left' + 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' + 'width' + 'padding-right' + 'border-right-width' + 'margin-right' = width of containing block

If 'width' is not 'auto' and 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' + 'width' + 'padding-right' + 'border-right-width' (plus any of 'margin-left' or 'margin-right' that are not 'auto') is larger than the width of the containing block, then any 'auto' values for 'margin-left' or 'margin-right' are, for the following rules, treated as zero.

If all of the above have a computed value other than 'auto', the values are said to be "over-constrained" and one of the used values will have to be different from its computed value. If the 'direction' property of the containing block has the value 'ltr', the specified value of 'margin-right' is ignored and the value is calculated so as to make the equality true. If the value of 'direction' is 'rtl', this happens to 'margin-left' instead.

If there is exactly one value specified as 'auto', its used value follows from the equality.

If 'width' is set to 'auto', any other 'auto' values become '0' and 'width' follows from the resulting equality.

If both 'margin-left' and 'margin-right' are 'auto', their used values are equal. This horizontally centers the element with respect to the edges of the containing block.

10.3.4 Block-level, replaced elements in normal flow

The used value of 'width' is determined as for inline replaced elements. Then the rules for non-replaced block-level elements are applied to determine the margins.

10.3.5 Floating, non-replaced elements

If 'margin-left', or 'margin-right' are computed as 'auto', their used value is '0'.

If 'width' is computed as 'auto', the used value is the "shrink-to-fit" width.

Calculation of the shrink-to-fit width is similar to calculating the width of a table cell using the automatic table layout algorithm. Roughly: calculate the preferred width by formatting the content without breaking lines other than where explicit line breaks occur, and also calculate the preferred minimum width, e.g., by trying all possible line breaks. CSS 2.1 does not define the exact algorithm. Thirdly, find the available width: in this case, this is the width of the containing block minus the used values of 'margin-left', 'border-left-width', 'padding-left', 'padding-right', 'border-right-width', 'margin-right', and the widths of any relevant scroll bars.

Then the shrink-to-fit width is: min(max(preferred minimum width, available width), preferred width).

10.3.6 Floating, replaced elements

If 'margin-left' or 'margin-right' are computed as 'auto', their used value is '0'. The used value of 'width' is determined as for inline replaced elements.

10.3.7 Absolutely positioned, non-replaced elements

For the purposes of this section and the next, the term "static position" (of an element) refers, roughly, to the position an element would have had in the normal flow. More precisely:

The static-position containing block is the containing block of a hypothetical box that would have been the first box of the element if its specified 'position' value had been 'static' and its specified 'float' had been 'none'. (Note that due to the rules in section 9.7 this hypothetical calculation might require also assuming a different computed value for 'display'.)
The static position for 'left' is the distance from the left edge of the containing block to the left margin edge of a hypothetical box that would have been the first box of the element if its 'position' property had been 'static' and 'float' had been 'none'. The value is negative if the hypothetical box is to the left of the containing block.
The static position for 'right' is the distance from the right edge of the containing block to the right margin edge of the same hypothetical box as above. The value is positive if the hypothetical box is to the left of the containing block's edge.
But rather than actually calculating the dimensions of that hypothetical box, user agents are free to make a guess at its probable position.

For the purposes of calculating the static position, the containing block of fixed positioned elements is the initial containing block instead of the viewport, and all scrollable boxes should be assumed to be scrolled to their origin.

The constraint that determines the used values for these elements is:

'left' + 'margin-left' + 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' + 'width' + 'padding-right' + 'border-right-width' + 'margin-right' + 'right' = width of containing block

If all three of 'left', 'width', and 'right' are 'auto': First set any 'auto' values for 'margin-left' and 'margin-right' to 0. Then, if the 'direction' property of the element establishing the static-position containing block is 'ltr' set 'left' to the static position and apply rule number three below; otherwise, set 'right' to the static position and apply rule number one below.

If none of the three is 'auto': If both 'margin-left' and 'margin-right' are 'auto', solve the equation under the extra constraint that the two margins get equal values, unless this would make them negative, in which case when direction of the containing block is 'ltr' ('rtl'), set 'margin-left' ('margin-right') to zero and solve for 'margin-right' ('margin-left'). If one of 'margin-left' or 'margin-right' is 'auto', solve the equation for that value. If the values are over-constrained, ignore the value for 'left' (in case the 'direction' property of the containing block is 'rtl') or 'right' (in case 'direction' is 'ltr') and solve for that value.

Otherwise, set 'auto' values for 'margin-left' and 'margin-right' to 0, and pick the one of the following six rules that applies.

'left' and 'width' are 'auto' and 'right' is not 'auto', then the width is shrink-to-fit. Then solve for 'left'
'left' and 'right' are 'auto' and 'width' is not 'auto', then if the 'direction' property of the element establishing the static-position containing block is 'ltr' set 'left' to the static position, otherwise set 'right' to the static position. Then solve for 'left' (if 'direction is 'rtl') or 'right' (if 'direction' is 'ltr').
'width' and 'right' are 'auto' and 'left' is not 'auto', then the width is shrink-to-fit . Then solve for 'right'
'left' is 'auto', 'width' and 'right' are not 'auto', then solve for 'left'
'width' is 'auto', 'left' and 'right' are not 'auto', then solve for 'width'
'right' is 'auto', 'left' and 'width' are not 'auto', then solve for 'right'
Calculation of the shrink-to-fit width is similar to calculating the width of a table cell using the automatic table layout algorithm. Roughly: calculate the preferred width by formatting the content without breaking lines other than where explicit line breaks occur, and also calculate the preferred minimum width, e.g., by trying all possible line breaks. CSS 2.1 does not define the exact algorithm. Thirdly, calculate the available width: this is found by solving for 'width' after setting 'left' (in case 1) or 'right' (in case 3) to 0.

Then the shrink-to-fit width is: min(max(preferred minimum width, available width), preferred width).

10.3.8 Absolutely positioned, replaced elements

In this case, section 10.3.7 applies up through and including the constraint equation, but the rest of section 10.3.7 is replaced by the following rules:

The used value of 'width' is determined as for inline replaced elements. If 'margin-left' or 'margin-right' is specified as 'auto' its used value is determined by the rules below.
If both 'left' and 'right' have the value 'auto', then if the 'direction' property of the element establishing the static-position containing block is 'ltr', set 'left' to the static position; else if 'direction' is 'rtl', set 'right' to the static position.
If 'left' or 'right' are 'auto', replace any 'auto' on 'margin-left' or 'margin-right' with '0'.
If at this point both 'margin-left' and 'margin-right' are still 'auto', solve the equation under the extra constraint that the two margins must get equal values, unless this would make them negative, in which case when the direction of the containing block is 'ltr' ('rtl'), set 'margin-left' ('margin-right') to zero and solve for 'margin-right' ('margin-left').
If at this point there is an 'auto' left, solve the equation for that value.
If at this point the values are over-constrained, ignore the value for either 'left' (in case the 'direction' property of the containing block is 'rtl') or 'right' (in case 'direction' is 'ltr') and solve for that value.
10.3.9 'Inline-block', non-replaced elements in normal flow

If 'width' is 'auto', the used value is the shrink-to-fit width as for floating elements.

A computed value of 'auto' for 'margin-left' or 'margin-right' becomes a used value of '0'.

10.3.10 'Inline-block', replaced elements in normal flow

Exactly as inline replaced elements.
```
这里只关注宽度算法，而position为relative的'left' and 'right'不影响元素宽度，这里不做讲解。

## 计算元素高度
在[css2.1 高度](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/visudet.html#Computing_heights_and_margins)中，有如下原话：
```
For calculating the values of 'top', 'margin-top', 'height', 'margin-bottom', and 'bottom' a distinction must be made between various kinds of boxes:

inline, non-replaced elements
inline, replaced elements
block-level, non-replaced elements in normal flow
block-level, replaced elements in normal flow
floating, non-replaced elements
floating, replaced elements
absolutely positioned, non-replaced elements
absolutely positioned, replaced elements
'inline-block', non-replaced elements in normal flow
'inline-block', replaced elements in normal flow
For Points 1-6 and 9-10, the used values of 'top' and 'bottom' are determined by the rules in section 9.4.3.

Note: these rules apply to the root element just as to any other element.

Note. The used value of 'height' calculated below is a tentative value, and may have to be calculated multiple times, depending on 'min-height' and 'max-height', see the section Minimum and maximum heights below.

10.6.1 Inline, non-replaced elements

The 'height' property does not apply. The height of the content area should be based on the font, but this specification does not specify how. A UA may, e.g., use the em-box or the maximum ascender and descender of the font. (The latter would ensure that glyphs with parts above or below the em-box still fall within the content area, but leads to differently sized boxes for different fonts; the former would ensure authors can control background styling relative to the 'line-height', but leads to glyphs painting outside their content area.)

Note: level 3 of CSS will probably include a property to select which measure of the font is used for the content height.

The vertical padding, border and margin of an inline, non-replaced box start at the top and bottom of the content area, and has nothing to do with the 'line-height'. But only the 'line-height' is used when calculating the height of the line box.

If more than one font is used (this could happen when glyphs are found in different fonts), the height of the content area is not defined by this specification. However, we suggest that the height is chosen such that the content area is just high enough for either (1) the em-boxes, or (2) the maximum ascenders and descenders, of all the fonts in the element. Note that this may be larger than any of the font sizes involved, depending on the baseline alignment of the fonts.

10.6.2 Inline replaced elements, block-level replaced elements in normal flow, 'inline-block' replaced elements in normal flow and floating replaced elements

If 'margin-top', or 'margin-bottom' are 'auto', their used value is 0.

If 'height' and 'width' both have computed values of 'auto' and the element also has an intrinsic height, then that intrinsic height is the used value of 'height'.

Otherwise, if 'height' has a computed value of 'auto', and the element has an intrinsic ratio then the used value of 'height' is:

(used width) / (intrinsic ratio)

Otherwise, if 'height' has a computed value of 'auto', and the element has an intrinsic height, then that intrinsic height is the used value of 'height'.

Otherwise, if 'height' has a computed value of 'auto', but none of the conditions above are met, then the used value of 'height' must be set to the height of the largest rectangle that has a 2:1 ratio, has a height not greater than 150px, and has a width not greater than the device width.

10.6.3 Block-level non-replaced elements in normal flow when 'overflow' computes to 'visible'

This section also applies to block-level non-replaced elements in normal flow when 'overflow' does not compute to 'visible' but has been propagated to the viewport.

If 'margin-top', or 'margin-bottom' are 'auto', their used value is 0. If 'height' is 'auto', the height depends on whether the element has any block-level children and whether it has padding or borders:

The element's height is the distance from its top content edge to the first applicable of the following:

the bottom edge of the last line box, if the box establishes a inline formatting context with one or more lines
the bottom edge of the bottom (possibly collapsed) margin of its last in-flow child, if the child's bottom margin does not collapse with the element's bottom margin
the bottom border edge of the last in-flow child whose top margin doesn't collapse with the element's bottom margin
zero, otherwise
Only children in the normal flow are taken into account (i.e., floating boxes and absolutely positioned boxes are ignored, and relatively positioned boxes are considered without their offset). Note that the child box may be an anonymous block box.

10.6.4 Absolutely positioned, non-replaced elements

For the purposes of this section and the next, the term "static position" (of an element) refers, roughly, to the position an element would have had in the normal flow. More precisely, the static position for 'top' is the distance from the top edge of the containing block to the top margin edge of a hypothetical box that would have been the first box of the element if its specified 'position' value had been 'static' and its specified 'float' had been 'none' and its specified 'clear' had been 'none'. (Note that due to the rules in section 9.7 this might require also assuming a different computed value for 'display'.) The value is negative if the hypothetical box is above the containing block.

But rather than actually calculating the dimensions of that hypothetical box, user agents are free to make a guess at its probable position.

For the purposes of calculating the static position, the containing block of fixed positioned elements is the initial containing block instead of the viewport.

For absolutely positioned elements, the used values of the vertical dimensions must satisfy this constraint:

'top' + 'margin-top' + 'border-top-width' + 'padding-top' + 'height' + 'padding-bottom' + 'border-bottom-width' + 'margin-bottom' + 'bottom' = height of containing block

If all three of 'top', 'height', and 'bottom' are auto, set 'top' to the static position and apply rule number three below.

If none of the three are 'auto': If both 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' are 'auto', solve the equation under the extra constraint that the two margins get equal values. If one of 'margin-top' or 'margin-bottom' is 'auto', solve the equation for that value. If the values are over-constrained, ignore the value for 'bottom' and solve for that value.

Otherwise, pick the one of the following six rules that applies.

'top' and 'height' are 'auto' and 'bottom' is not 'auto', then the height is based on the content per 10.6.7, set 'auto' values for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' to 0, and solve for 'top'
'top' and 'bottom' are 'auto' and 'height' is not 'auto', then set 'top' to the static position, set 'auto' values for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' to 0, and solve for 'bottom'
'height' and 'bottom' are 'auto' and 'top' is not 'auto', then the height is based on the content per 10.6.7, set 'auto' values for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' to 0, and solve for 'bottom'
'top' is 'auto', 'height' and 'bottom' are not 'auto', then set 'auto' values for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' to 0, and solve for 'top'
'height' is 'auto', 'top' and 'bottom' are not 'auto', then 'auto' values for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' are set to 0 and solve for 'height'
'bottom' is 'auto', 'top' and 'height' are not 'auto', then set 'auto' values for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' to 0 and solve for 'bottom'
10.6.5 Absolutely positioned, replaced elements

This situation is similar to the previous one, except that the element has an intrinsic height. The sequence of substitutions is now:

The used value of 'height' is determined as for inline replaced elements. If 'margin-top' or 'margin-bottom' is specified as 'auto' its used value is determined by the rules below.
If both 'top' and 'bottom' have the value 'auto', replace 'top' with the element's static position.
If 'bottom' is 'auto', replace any 'auto' on 'margin-top' or 'margin-bottom' with '0'.
If at this point both 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' are still 'auto', solve the equation under the extra constraint that the two margins must get equal values.
If at this point there is only one 'auto' left, solve the equation for that value.
If at this point the values are over-constrained, ignore the value for 'bottom' and solve for that value.
10.6.6 Complicated cases

This section applies to:

Block-level, non-replaced elements in normal flow when 'overflow' does not compute to 'visible' (except if the 'overflow' property's value has been propagated to the viewport).
'Inline-block', non-replaced elements.
Floating, non-replaced elements.
If 'margin-top', or 'margin-bottom' are 'auto', their used value is 0. If 'height' is 'auto', the height depends on the element's descendants per 10.6.7.

For 'inline-block' elements, the margin box is used when calculating the height of the line box.

10.6.7 'Auto' heights for block formatting context roots

In certain cases (see, e.g., sections 10.6.4 and 10.6.6 above), the height of an element that establishes a block formatting context is computed as follows:

If it only has inline-level children, the height is the distance between the top of the topmost line box and the bottom of the bottommost line box.

If it has block-level children, the height is the distance between the top margin-edge of the topmost block-level child box and the bottom margin-edge of the bottommost block-level child box.

Absolutely positioned children are ignored, and relatively positioned boxes are considered without their offset. Note that the child box may be an anonymous block box.

In addition, if the element has any floating descendants whose bottom margin edge is below the element's bottom content edge, then the height is increased to include those edges. Only floats that participate in this block formatting context are taken into account, e.g., floats inside absolutely positioned descendants or other floats are not.
```
Inline non-replaced元素
    height属性不适用，高度应该是基于字体计算的

Inline replaced元素、正常流中的Block-level replaced元素、正常流中的'Inline-block' replaced元素、floating replaced元素
    同计算Inline replaced元素算法差不多，只是最后一项情况中的高度不超过150px和设备高度

Block-level non-replaced elements in normal flow when 'overflow' computes to 'visible'

Absolutely positioned non-replaced元素
    'top' + 'margin-top' + 'border-top-width' + 'padding-top' + 'height' + 'padding-bottom' + 'border-bottom-width' + 'margin-bottom' + 'bottom' = height of containing block
    算法同宽度算法相似，不再累述
